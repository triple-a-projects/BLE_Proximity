## About

Traditional attendance management methods, relying on manual roll-calls, are susceptible to errors and manipulation. Teachers calling out roll numbers may lead to proxy roll calls, where students mimic voices to mark their presence fraudulently. Assigning attendance tracking to class representatives introduces biases or even false markings. To address these challenges, a technological intervention is crucial for accurate attendance tracking and elimination of biases in the system.

This project aims to transform attendance tracking by creating a Bluetooth-based Attendance system for monitoring student presence during class hours. Specific objectives include:

- Designing a Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) prototype using ESP32 for proximity sensing to record attendance efficiently.
- Eliminating time-consuming traditional roll calls.
- Preventing proxy roll calls through physical presence verification.

## Features

- **Role-Based Login:** The system supports login for both teachers and students, providing a personalized experience based on user roles.

- **Student Authentication:** Students can authenticate themselves using fingerprint and face unlock features, ensuring secure and accurate attendance tracking.

- **Personalized Dashboards:** Users are presented with personalized dashboards, offering a convenient overview of attendance records and other relevant information.

- **Attendance Checking:** The system includes features for easily checking and monitoring attendance, promoting transparency and efficiency in the process.

## Technologies Used

- **ESP32:** Utilized for proximity sensing to enhance the accuracy of attendance tracking.

- **Flutter:** Used for app development, creating a user-friendly interface for teachers and students.

- **Firebase:** Utilized as the database system to store and manage attendance records securely.
